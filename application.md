# How to get a very good application!

Read the [official student guide](http://write.flossmanuals.net/gsocstudentguide/what-is-google-summer-of-code/)
with detail. There are many hints on how to increase your chances to get
accepted.

Take particular attention on the proposal examples. A good proposal has to
show that you understand the project you want to work during the summer. 
You should include a plan of your work, the most detailed the better.
The plan may change during the summer, and that's ok, but if you don't 
get a detailed plan then you won't know whether you are going very very
bad or just a bit out of schedule.

Notice that one of the requirements is to send us some sample of code
you have done. If you are shortlisted we will interview you via Hangouts
and ask you about that piece of code. It can be anything, from a Pull-Request
that you may have done to an open source project to an assignment that you
did any of your subjects.

Below we offer a template as the one available in the submission page:
