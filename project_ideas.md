# Projects Ideas

Welcome to our list of ideas, here you will find what you can
do for our three projects:

- Have an impact on the study of archaeological pads helping [ORACC](#oracc).
- Things to do with anonymisation and [critical care](#cleanehr) data analysis.
- Compressing data in astrophysics with [BASP](#basp).

## ORACC
<!-- Description of project -->
The ancient cultures of Sumer, Assyria and Babylonia have left a rich written legacy, in the form of many hundreds of thousands of clay tablets, inscribed in the complex, wedge-shaped cuneiform script. Over the past two centuries these artefacts, dating from c.3000 BC to c.100 AD, have been excavated from archaeological sites across the Middle East, particularly Iraq and Syria, and are now housed in many different museums around the world.

For several decades now there has been a concerted effort to catalogue, photograph, edit and analyse these most precious witnesses of the first half of history. The editorial and analytical effort has been spearheaded by ORACC, the Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus, co-directed by ]Professor Eleanor Robson](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/history/people/academic-staff/eleanor-robson) at UCL, along with international colleagues.

### Ideas
#### Nammu: a modern tool for editing the world's oldest texts
In this project, you will be working on the development of a cross platform desktop text edition tool. This tool will be vital for the ORACC researchers all over the world to continue contributing to their catalogue of ancient writings. This tool will be built using the latest web technologies as well as taking advantage of existing Open Source projects like [Electron](http://electron.atom.io), the library developed by GitHub used to create the text editor [Atom](https://atom.io).

**Requirements:**
* Programming skills
* Demonstrable experience on HTML, CSS, JavaScript (preferably AngularJS)
* An interest in applying and learning good programming practises

**Benefit for the student:**
 * Contribution to an Open Source project with international impact
 * Improve programming skills and practises

**Benefit for the project:**
 * Start a new path for replacing the existing semi functional editor
  with a modern, cross-platform alternative.

**Difficulty:**
 * Medium-Advanced
