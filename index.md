The [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)
(GSOC) is a programme where Google funds students to work in open
source projects during their summer break.

This year UCL is applying to participate in that amazing programme 
with the mentoring of the [Research Software Development Group](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/research-it-services/research-software-development).
RSDG's goal is to help researchers to produce high quality research software.
In such process we have created or contributed to software that has been
released as open source. These projects ranges from working with archaeologists,
to astrophysicists, chemists to critical care doctors and many more.

For this year - our first time applying to participate at GSOC - we are proposing
three of our projects:

* [cleanEHR](https://github.com/CC-HIC/cleanEHR) - a set of R libraries to help doctors to 
  analyse critical care data but extensible to other health systems.
* [ORACC](http://oracc.org) - a set of tools to transcribe archaeological  cuneiform texts
  and test their lemmatization.
* [BASP](http://basp.eps.hw.ac.uk) - Signal compression and processing for biomedical and
  astronomical data.

## That's cool... How do I participate?

First you need to be [eligible by Google]() - in short, you need to be a student!

Then you should look at the [project ideas](ideas/), [contact us](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/ucl-gsoc),
plan [your application](application/) and discuss it with the mentors. 
Finally, don't forget to submit it before the 3rd of April!
