With the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (GSOC),
Google funds students to work on open source projects during their summer
break.

This year UCL is applying to participate in this amazing programme. Mentoring
will be provided by the [Research Software Development
Group](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/research-it-services/research-software-development).
RSDG's goal is to help researchers produce high quality research software.
We've got our hands dirty coding open-source software with UCL researchers from
all domains of knowledge, whether with archaeologists and astronomers, or
chemists and medical doctors.

For this year - our first time applying to participate at GSOC - we are proposing
three of our projects:

* [cleanEHR](https://github.com/CC-HIC/cleanEHR) - an extensible set of R
libraries to help doctors analyse data for health systems, especially critical
care
* [ORACC](http://oracc.org) - a set of tools to transcribe archaeological
cuneiform texts and test their lemmatization
* [BASP](http://basp.eps.hw.ac.uk) - Signal compression and processing for biomedical and
  astronomical data

## That's cool... How do I participate?

First you need to meet Google's [eligibility
criteria](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq#what_are_the_eligibility_requirements_for_participation)
- in short, you need to be a student!

Then you should look at the [project ideas](ideas/), [contact
us](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/ucl-gsoc), plan [your
application](application/) and discuss it with the mentors.  Finally, don't
forget to submit it before the 3rd of April!
